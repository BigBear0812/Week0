This is Jim's Challenge Week 0

Jim's Weekly Web Challenge - Level 0
Alright! So this is the first of many web challenges!
 
Below is a screenshot of a page. You need to recreate that page.
 
Like it said in the intro email, don't worry about recreating the exact look, just focus on layout and semantics.
 
Shoot me an email when you complete it and I will get back to you as soon as possible!
 
(Not all will be this simple, we just need a solid starting point.)
